## About The Project

Bumbadum is a creative endeavor that strives to establish a congenial environment for enjoying music with friends. Through customizable avatars and real-time interaction, participants can traverse the virtual landscape, engage with fellow players, and harmoniously synchronize music playback. This project not only facilitates shared music experiences but also serves as a personal journey of exploration, encompassing websockets and game development without external frameworks or engines.
